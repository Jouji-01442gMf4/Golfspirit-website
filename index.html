    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p> Ogar Golfspirit is a nonprofit organisation committed to making golf accessible to everyone in Amsterdam
        Zuid-Oost.
        Our mission is to remove barriers so that people of all ages, backgrounds, and abilities can enjoy the benefits
        of the sport.
        Golf encourages outdoor activity, promotes physical fitness, and supports mental well-being by combining
        exercise, focus, and relaxation.
        We aim to create opportunities for people to connect, learn, and grow together through the game.</p>

    <h3>About Golf</h3>
    <p> Golf is more than just a sport. It is a lifelong activity that can be adapted to individual abilities, making it
        inclusive for beginners, children, seniors, and people with limited mobility.
        Because it is low-impact, golf provides a safe way to stay active without placing excessive strain on the body.
        Playing regularly helps improve balance, coordination, concentration, and overall health.
        Beyond the physical benefits, golf is also highly social. It encourages people to meet, share experiences, and
        build friendships in a welcoming environment.
        These qualities make golf a valuable activity for communities, where both young and old can participate, support
        one another, and enjoy meaningful time outdoors.</p>

<div class="Offer">
    <h3> The offer </h3>
    <p> Following golf lessons is possible at two fixed times during the week, namely on Wednesday afternoon and Saturday. In
    consultation it is possible to follow lessons at different times. In the case of bad weather it is possible to switch to the
    indoor location.
    
    Following free trial lesson(s) is part of the introduction program. New students can always come and watch and have a taste
    of the programme during an outdoor lesson.
